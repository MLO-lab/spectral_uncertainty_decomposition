**Example**
Task description: Determine the length of a sentence.
Input: "To be or not to be, that is the question."
Reasoning: The task asks for the length of the sentence, which I interpret as the total count of characters, including letters, spaces, punctuation, and any other symbols. Counting all characters in the given input string will yield the correct length of the sentence. Quotation marks will not be included since they are considered as delimiters and not part of the sentence.
