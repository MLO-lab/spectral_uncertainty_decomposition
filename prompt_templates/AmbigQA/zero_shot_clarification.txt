**Objective**
Analyze the given question for ambiguities. If the question is ambiguous, your task is to clarify it by interpreting the ambiguous concepts, specifying necessary conditions, or using other methods. Provide as much different clarifications as possible.
An ambiguous question is a question that has different correct answers, depending on individual interpretations. Your clarifications are supposed to remove any ambiguity in the question so every clarified question will have a single possible correct answer. These ambiguities can arise from various factors, including but not limited to:  
1. Ambiguous references to entities in the question. 
2. Multiple properties of objects/entities in the question leading to different interpretations.  
3. Ambiguities due to unclear timestamps. 
4. Ambiguities stemming from unclear locations. 
5. Multiple valid answer types based on the question.  
6. References to undefined or underspecified entities in the question.

**Important Rules**
1. Perform detailed analyses before concluding whether the question is clear or ambiguous. In the analyses, you can rely on your general knowledge to anticipate possible correct answers and interpretations of the question.
2. Output clarifications in the specified format. Do not include possible answers in the clarifications. The clarifications should be only more precise rephrasings of the same question.
3. For each ambiguous question, you are to provide at least two distinct rephrasings that resolve these ambiguities. By "rephrasing," we mean you should reformulate the question to be clear and direct, eliminating any possible ambiguity without altering the original intent of the question. You should not seek further information or produce a binary (yes-no) question as a result of the clarification. Instead, you must create a direct question (wh-question) that aims to obtain a specific answer.
4. Do not provide more than 10 clarifications for an ambiguous question.
5. Do not provide placeholders in your clarifications. They must be fully contained explicit questions. If the question refers to an undefined entity, provide possible values and definitions for the entity in different clarifications.
6. Do not add explainations within the clarifications of the questions. All your reasoning, analyses and explaination should be contained in the Analyses section only.


**Output Format**
Your output should follow this format:
### Analyses:
[Think step-by-step to reason on the clarity of the question, possible answers and interpretations. After that, output your judgement on whether the question is ambiguous or not]

### Clarifications:
#1 [First rephrased question]
#2 [Second rephrased question]
#3 [Third rephrased question]
...

If the question is clear and unambiguous, simply output:
### Clarifications:
#1 No clarification needed.
